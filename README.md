Mush and Squush: Soft-Body Physics
==================================

This is my soft-body physics talk for [360|iDev](http://360idev.com/) 2013 given on Tues, Sept 10, 2013. I wrote two fun demo apps to demonstrate some aspects of soft-body physics on iOS 6.

__SquishyBalls__

* 2d circles and squares that are soft (like a nerf ball) -- uses box2d, cocos2d 2.1, and some custom OpenGL ES 2.0 drawing

__WateryBalls__

* 2d particles that attract and repel like a fluid (like water droplets on glass) -- uses cocos2d 2.1
