Mush and Squush: Soft-Body Physics
==================================

This is my soft-body physics talk for 360|iDev 2013 given on Sept 10, 2013. Includes a few demo apps I wrote to demonstrate some aspects of soft-body physics on iOS:

__SquishyBalls__

* soft 2d circles in a box (like a crate full of nerf basketballs) -- uses box2d and cocos2d 2.1

__WateryBalls__

* hard 2d circles that attract and repel (kinda like water droplets on glass) -- uses cocos2d 2.1
